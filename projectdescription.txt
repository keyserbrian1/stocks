Companies
  Have a name
    Name is procedurally generated
  Have a unique stock symbol, based on name
  Belong to one or more industries
    Industries describe the company, and determine what events affect it.***
    Industries partially depend on name, with random growth outwards
  Have 10000 shares, given to new players 10/player. 5000 are "owned" by the company, and can't be obtained. (Implicit 500 player cap, doesn't matter due to low expected # of players.)
    Shares pay dividends based on calculated profit. (Profit is divided among all shares evenly, unowned "player" shares pay no dividends anywhere)**
      Dividends immediately cause all buy/sell orders to drop by dividend price, or cancel if it's negative
      Company receives remaining profit (unsold shares) to their funds.
  Have a "bank" of funds**
    If the bank drops below 0, company takes out loan, pays interest on loan.
      This immediately generates a "Dire Financial Straits" event.***
        "Dire Financial Straits" event causes a moderate loss of confidence in the company
    If the bank hits -20% of their starting cash, company enters bankruptcy.
      Bankruptcy causes funds to go to 0
      Bankruptcy causes expenses for that quarter to be 0
      Bankruptcy causes dividends to be halved for that quarter
      Bankruptcy generates a "Bankruptcy" event.***
        "Bankruptcy" event causes major loss of confidence in the company, minor loss in the company's industry, and a miniscule loss globally
        "Bankruptcy" event can cause a hit to profits of other companies, depending on industries
      A second bankruptcy within one year causes company to close, making all shares worthless.
        This generates a "Company Closed" event***
          "Company Closed" event causes moderate loss of confidence in the company's industry, and a minor loss globally
          "Company Closed" event can cause a hit to profits of other companies, depending on industries
      Starting cash depends on industry**
      Pays expenses after earning profits, quarterly (1.5 days real-time)
        Profits and expenses are calculated depending on events and a pre-determined profitability value, derived partially by industry
    Perform a stock split if stock price trades too high***
      Blocking issue: Define "too high"
      All players double their amount of stock
      All outstanding orders halve their price and double their amount
      Generates a "Stock Split" event
        Produces minor raise in confidence for company

Users
  Have a username that identifies them
  Have a portfolio of shares and funds
    Receive dividends based on portfolio**
  Have a ranking based on net worth*

Admins**
  Are a User in full
  Do not appear in the rankings, and have an infinite balance
  Should not be playing normally; a separate account should be used for regular play
  May have a duplicate email with a standard user
  Can create new companies
  Can change a company's industries
  Can change a company's profit/expenses
  Can obtain stocks from the "new user reserve" for free
  Can modify other users' data
  Can modify other users' money
  Can cancel other users' offers
  Can force a user to make an offer
  Can trigger a positive or negative event***
  Admin behavior creates an "act of god" event***
    Normally, this event has no effect on confidences; it is merely to inform the users that an admin has acted.
    If the admin chose to deliberately trigger an event, the event has the admin-specified effects on confidences.
      The admin can not both boost and impair confidences with one event
    If the admin affects profit, then confidences are affected like any other profit-modifying event
      This is to prevent the AI player's confidences from being out of line with the expected profit.


AI Users
  Are a User in full
  Have a "confidence" globally, per industry, and per company
    Confidence determines whether they buy, sell, or hold, and at what price
    Confidence depends on events(***) and pre-generated preferences
      AI users have a "preference" for each industry that determines whether they're inclined to buy or sell in that industry
    Confidence depends on stock history
      Different AI users use different algorithms to determine confidence based on history
  Username is randomly-selected
    Instead, username depends on confidence algorithm and preferences****
  Receive an extra in-game month to set up the market before normal users can trade.

Orders
  Are either buy or sell
    Buy orders deduct funds on creation, and return shares when completed
    Sell orders set aside shares on creation, and return cash when completed
      Sell orders permit "selling short", selling unowned shares**
        Short sell orders must have a equivalent "Buy" order within one in-game year from being fulfilled
          This order will immediately be created and fulfilled at the current price if the time limit expires
            If there are insufficient shares available, ??? (blocks Short Sell until defined)
          If an automatic purchase requires more funds than are available, takes out a loan to cover the difference
        Short sell orders pay negative dividends on the missing shares
          If there aren't enough funds, a loan covers the difference
  Immediately fulfil when an order of the other type is created at the same or better price
    Actual price is the price of whichever order was earlier
  May be cancelled by the creator as long as they haven't been fulfilled

Events***
  Are randomly generated out of a list
  Have a description that gives clues to their effects on the companies
  Can cause confidence in companies to shift
  Can affect profitability or expenses
  Affect a single company, an industry, or all companies
    One event can affect multiple groups differently
  Can also be generated by in-game effects
    So far, only "Dire Financial Straits", "Bankruptcy", "Company Closed", "Stock Split" and "Act of God" are generated by effects
  Target companies/industries randomly, but can be influenced by other events
  Have a chance of not actually occurring, influenced by past events.

Game end****
  After a pre-determined amount of time, (2 in-game years/12 days?) game ends and regenerates world
  Prior history is visible on a separate "past games" page
  Winner is announced to everyone on next login.
